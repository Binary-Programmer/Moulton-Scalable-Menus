# Menu Components Overview
Each program and each menu may need a different set of menu components. Therefore, all components can be extended and modified by the programmer for specific needs. Nevertheless, a collection of the most commonly used components has been provided.

## Positioning
The premise of Moulton Scalable Menus is that the components are arbitrarily scalable. As such, positioning is of great importance. There are two systems established whereby components can be positioned, by expressions and by the panel grid. Each has its own pros and cons, so both systems can be used together in the same menu, even on the same panel.

When a component is created, it asks for its parent panel and asks for either strings of location or integers for location. The strings are to be string expressions. The integers are to be the component's position on the parent's grid. Regardless of positioning system, the component will add itself as a child of the parent automatically.

### Expressions
Components may be given string expressions that are evaluated at render time to determine where the component should be positioned. Expressions are evaluated in double float precision, but are rounded to the nearest integer to conform to pixel coordinates when the value is used. The top left corner of the screen is (0,0). The rightward direction is +x. The downward direction is +y. Expressions may use operators, literals, and a defined set of variables. It should also be mentioned that there is a wild character `?` implemented out of convenience in many components.

#### Operators
The operators are pretty standard:
* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`): Also serves as the symbol for negation.
* Multiplication (`*`): When no operator is provided, multiplication is assumed. For example, `2pi` is evaluated as `2 * pi`.
* Division (`/`)
* Exponentiation (`^`)
* Root (`r`): As in the square root, which is denoted by `2r`. So to be explicit, the square root of 16 would be written as `2r16`.
* Parantheses (`( )`): Precedence rules are automatically followed in evaluating the expresssion. However, when another order must be performed, parantheses prove very useful.

Additionally, a select few functions may be utilized (Functions do not need parantheses for their argument):
* Trigonometric functions `cos`, `sin`, and `tan`. The argument is expected to be in radians.
* Logarithmic functions `log` and `ln`. These are the logarithms in base 10 and base e, respectively.

#### Literals
Literal numbers can be given as integers or as floats. Regardless of input, calculations will take place in double precision. Numbers can also be given in scientifc notation, following the form:
```
<significand> E <exponent>
```
Please note that:
* This is the form that Java doubles use for scientific notation. No conversion is necessary.
* The base, `E`, must be capitalized to distinguish it from the variable `e`.
* Negative exponents do not require parantheses. For example, `6.674Eâˆ’11` is equivalent to `6.674E(-11)`.
* Spaces between the three parts may be added or removed to preference.

#### Variables
The following variables may be used in expressions:
* `width`: the width of the parent panel
* `height`: the height of the parent panel
* `centerx`: the horizontal center of the parent panel. Equivalent to `width/2`.
* `centery`: the vertical center of the parent panel. Equivalent to `height/2`.
* `pi`: the value of pi in double precision (3.1415926536)
* `e`: the value of e in double precision (2.7182818285)

#### Wild Character
The wild character, `?`, may also be used in some specific instances, as implemented by the menu component.

First, the wild character may be used in most rectangular components in the width or height field to indicate an endpoint. So if width =`?width/3`, the component would stretch from its x to a third the width of the parent panel. This is especially useful to mitigate rounding error.

Second, the wild character may be used in in inherently one-dimensional components (such as moulton.scalable.geometrics.Line) as a ditto. If the x2 or y2 fields are the wild character, then the component assumes that x2=x1 or y2=y1, respectively.

### Grid
Grids are often very useful in the design of a menu. (0,0) corresponds to the component at the top left corner of the grid. The rightward direction is +x. The downward direction is +y. Components can be added to any location on the grid (as long as the integer is 0 or positive) and the grid will automatically expand when necessary. Rows and columns do not need to be full. For example, if the only component in the grid was at (1,0), the grid would still be split in half horizontally.

There are some components (notably the shape components) that take both grid and expression fields. These components are encorporated in the grid as others, and the expressions are used to dictate their shape within their grid allotment.

There are several non-component factors to the rendering of the grid; Grids can have frames, margins, and weights.

#### Frame
Grid frames are on the external border. The frame determines how much space should be between the components inside the grid and the outside of the parent panel. The frame is divided into two parts: horizontal and vertical.

#### Margin
The grid margin is the space between components in the grid. The margin is divided into two parts: horizontal and vertical.

#### Weights
Row weights and column weights can be used to increase the size of specific rows or columns in the grid. By default, all rows and columns have a weight of 1.0. A row with a weight of 2.0 would have double the height of a row with a width of 1.0. Similarly, a column with a weight of 0.5 would have half the width of a column with a weight of 1.0.

### Virtual Space
Virtual space is a powerful concept where components exist within the menu design but are not necessarily visible to the user. An example of a component with virtual space is a small text box that holds many lines of text, but only the lines directly adjacent to where the user is entering data is visible. Components that use virtual space commonly use scroll bars to give the user access to the whole structure. The generic `moulton.scalable.containers.Panel` does not allow for virtual space, but the classes and subclasses of `moulton.scalable.containers.PanelPlus`, `moulton.scalable.texts.TextBox`, and `moulton.scalable.texts.TextHistory` do.

## Components
Now that it has broadly been explained how the components work, now we will give an overview of components available for use.

### Panels
Panels serve as the backbone for the tree structure of the menu. All panels extend `moulton.scalable.containers.Panel`, which provides basic panel functionality. `moulton.scalable.containers.PartitionPanel` is a subclass of the Panel class with boundaries alterable during runtime. This contrasts from the regular Panel because these boundary changes occur outside of size changes, for example, if the user wanted to change the size of a panel relative to others.

`moulton.scalable.containers.PanelPlus` gives the programmer the ability to utilize virtual space for the menu design. `moulton.scalable.containers.ListPanel` is a subclass of the PanelPlus, specially designed to hold components in a dynamically sized list.

### Clickables
Foremost among clickables are buttons, which all inherit from the abstract class `moulton.scalable.clickables.RadioButton`. Don't be confused by the name: all buttons have the functionality in place to be radio buttons, but only if they are in a `moulton.scalable.clickables.RadioGroup`. The most commonly used button is `moulton.scalable.clickables.Button`, but there are also image buttons, animated buttons, and polygonal buttons.

### Text Components
There are text components like captions, which are simply static text, and text boxes, that can be modified by the user at runtime. Another useful component is the text history, which can display a dynamic list of messages.

### Visuals
There are components specifically designed to handle images or animations. There are also clickable button components corresponding to each of the static versions.

### Shapes
There are components to draw lines and polygons. `moulton.scalable.geometrics.ShapeResources` can be very useful in creating geometric shapes for these components.

### Pop Ups
Although pop ups do not generally fit the mold of scalable components, there is an avaiable framework for pop up components. Unlike regular components, pop ups need to be added directly to the menu manager as the `popup` field. These pop ups have an associated root panel `base`, which can be built off of just like the regular menu root.
