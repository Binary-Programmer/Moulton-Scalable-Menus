/**
 * The clickables package contains classes that pertain to menu components that can be clicked.
 * This package contains the abstract class {@link Clickable}, which all clickable components derive
 * from, as well as {@link RadioButton}, which is the generalized ancestor for any rectangular button
 * components. <p>
 * 
 * Each clickable component has an identification string, which is used internally to keep track of
 * components. The identification string has no inherent meaning otherwise, so it can be assigned
 * arbitrarily at the programmer's choice.
